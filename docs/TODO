# Roughly in priority order

* Design and implement OPTIONAL service uuid storage; maybe we mandate that
this is always passed in, and random otherwise.  Managers remember, agents
forget? What about agent recovery? We did part of this in manager.

* Implement queuing "plugin"; a way to control if we queue or submit and watch
an external queuing solution (ex: slurm)

* Move from print debugging

* Migrate Django installation to an installable app

* Make data-retransmits consistent (ignore resends, or send them on)

* Do something with signatures.  Example: Did we get DataReady from the person
* we expect?

* Make "caroni_exchange" a setting
