# Roughly in priority order

1) Decide how WF client find WF manager AND/or if there is a static topic they
can post to like agent.fulfillment

2) Fail a job if the JSON does not parse, as well as other execution failure
modes

3) Design and implement OPTIONAL service uuid storage; maybe we mandate that
this is always passed in, and random otherwise.  Managers remember, agents
forget? What about agent recovery?
