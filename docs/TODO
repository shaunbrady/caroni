# Roughly in priority order

* Make WOrkflowSteps and Workflows cascade failures

* Design and implement OPTIONAL service uuid storage; maybe we mandate that
this is always passed in, and random otherwise.  Managers remember, agents

* Implement queuing "plugin"; a way to control if we queue or submit and watch
an external queuing solution (ex: slurm)

* Define behavior for when receiving data again for a given input

* Move from print debugging

* Migrate Django installation to an installable app

* Make "caroni_exchange" a setting
